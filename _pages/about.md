I am a fourth-year PhD student on Optimization and Control in [EPF Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), supervised by Prof. [Giancarlo Ferrari Trecate](https://people.epfl.ch/giancarlo.ferraritrecate) and [Prof. Maryam Kamgarpour](https://people.epfl.ch/maryam.kamgarpour?lang=en). My current research interest is model-free optimization with its application in power system operation, controller tuning and reinforcement learning. Previously, I obtained my Master degree in Electrical Engineering from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My dual Bachelor degrees from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn) are in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics.
